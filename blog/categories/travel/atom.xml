    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Daniel and I traveled Pretoria this afternoon, since Jan told us the <code>jacaranda</code> there are very beautiful.
We went out apartment around 2:30pm, and arriving Pretoria around half past three, cause there are over 60km between Johannesburg and Pretoria.</p>

<p>After we arrived, we went to a restaurant which is called <code>Harrie's</code>.</p>

<p>But unfortunately, There was start raining during our lunch(The weather in SA is ridiculous).So we have to decided working around the nearest park which name is <code>Venning Park</code>.</p>
